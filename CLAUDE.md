We are currently writing a book in AI Inference by Self Hosting.    The master outline is in master_outline.md and our
incremental progress is captured in TODO.md

Our goal is to finish this book.

A few things to watch out for:

* Write in small increments of 200 to 500 words so we can review as we go.
* This is end of 2025 and this book will be published in 2026.   Make sure when you use examples they are relevant, has
references and links and is as recent as possible.   You are allowed to use web search for finding these.
