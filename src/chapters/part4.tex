\part{The Inference Lab}
\label{part:inference-lab}

Part IV represents the culmination of everything you've learned. We push to 400B parameter models, deploy on H100 GPUs, and build CodeLab---a commercial-grade AI coding assistant that rivals GitHub Copilot.

This is where you become a world-class AI infrastructure operator.

\textbf{What You'll Learn:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Deploy and serve 400B+ parameter models
\item Optimize for H100/A100 datacenter GPUs
\item Build a complete commercial AI product (CodeLab)
\item Advanced performance optimization techniques
\item Enterprise-grade reliability and operations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What You'll Build:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Control Plane v1.0 (production-complete)
\item 400B model deployment on 8x H100 cluster
\item CodeLab: AI coding assistant
\item IDE integrations (VS Code, JetBrains)
\item Complete operational infrastructure
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hardware Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Target: 400B parameter models
\item Recommended: 8x H100 80GB with NVLink
\item Alternative: Cloud GPU cluster (expensive!)
\item Total VRAM: 640GB minimum
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Control Plane v1.0:}

The final evolution includes all features from v0.1--v0.3 plus:
\begin{itemize}
\item Large-scale distributed inference
\item Advanced observability and tracing
\item Automated failover and recovery
\item Cost optimization at scale
\item Enterprise integrations
\end{itemize}
