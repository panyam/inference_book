\part{Multi-Tenant Platform}
\label{part:multitenant}

Part III transforms your inference service into a multi-tenant platform. We scale to 70B parameter models across multiple GPUs, add tenant isolation, implement billing, and build the infrastructure for serving multiple organizations.

This is where you become an AI infrastructure provider.

\textbf{What You'll Learn:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Design tenant isolation for security and fairness
\item Implement usage tracking and billing systems
\item Build distributed inference with tensor parallelism
\item Create model routing that balances cost and quality
\item Deploy across multiple GPU nodes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What You'll Build:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Control Plane v0.3 with multi-tenancy
\item Tenant isolation and quota management
\item Usage tracking and billing integration
\item Multi-GPU inference with tensor parallelism
\item Intelligent model routing
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hardware Progression:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Target: 70B parameter models
\item Recommended: 2x A100 80GB or 2x RTX 4090
\item Tensor parallelism across multiple GPUs
\item Multiple inference nodes for scale
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Control Plane v0.3 Additions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tenant/organization management
\item Isolation between tenants
\item Usage metering and billing
\item Multi-GPU orchestration
\item Model routing with cost awareness
\end{itemize}
