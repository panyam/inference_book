\part{Production Deployment}
\label{part:production}

With the foundations in place, Part II transforms your inference system into a production-ready service. We scale up to 30B parameter models, add essential production features, and prepare for real users.

This is where the control plane becomes a genuine platform. Authentication, rate limiting, caching, and proper request management turn a demo into a service you can rely on.

\textbf{What You'll Learn:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Secure your API with authentication (API keys, JWTs)
\item Implement rate limiting and quota management
\item Add intelligent caching to reduce compute costs
\item Build a request queue for handling load spikes
\item Optimize for 30B models with proper memory management
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What You'll Build:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Control Plane v0.2 with production features
\item Multi-model routing system
\item Request queue with priority handling
\item Comprehensive rate limiting
\item Production-grade caching layer
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hardware Progression:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Target: 30B parameter models
\item Recommended: RTX 4090 24GB or A100 40GB
\item Cloud alternative: GPU instances on RunPod/Lambda
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Control Plane v0.2 Additions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Authentication middleware
\item Rate limiting with configurable policies
\item Semantic caching for common queries
\item Priority queue system
\item Multi-model backend support
\end{itemize}
